# Testing
The current code tests the overall operation of the coordinator and worker code. This is enough for this prototype, for production, real tests are needed. Coverage is used to provide the coverage of the code at the end of the tests.

The tests requires etcd3 to be installed on the device/server. Modify the config file if needed.

Execute run_tests.sh to run.
